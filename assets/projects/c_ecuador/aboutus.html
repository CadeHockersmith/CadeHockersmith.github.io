                        Sai was the HTML coder for Tech $upport. He did most of the HTML and also helped Navreet with the CSS. After Navreet finished the basis of the HTML and CSS for our new site, Sai finished the rest of the site, reduced the line count in the CSS from 800 to 600, and also helped format all of the content and images. Items such as links, tables, and paragraphs were coded by Sai in order to make the site look exactly how it does right now. Sai put in the footer and manually did the CSS for it as well.

                        Cade is the main researcher for the content on our site. His great knowledge of the local cuisine and the many landmarks/tourist attractions has helped us fill up the food page with a variety of delicious meals and the locations page with many attractions for any tourist to come and view during their time in Ecuador. All information presented on the site is checked by Cade to ensure that it is correct.

                        Navreet was the CSS guy for our group. He coded the CSS to make the site look the way it is right now. Things such as the nav, title, body, background, etc. were all coded to the look the way they are now by him. He created the mockup that we actually didn’t work off of because he later changed the design. He helped a little with the HTML coding, but that was mostly done by Sai. As the the contract of our group says, he was the maker-looker-gooder.
