                <p class='projectDescription'>This project introduced the concepts of branding while working with a client. Groups were expected to actively engaging with the client to understand their mission statement.

                <p class='projectDescription'>My designs focused on maintaining a minimalist layout that easily conveyed information to users. I wanted to create a clean website that clearly emphasized information. To implement this, I limited the amount of elements on the page, so users could easily navigate the page. I began my design process by recognizing that the logo should guide the design’s purpose. My website focused on creating an effective space that guides the reader through the page.</p>

                <p class='projectDescription'>This project introduced the concepts of branding while reviewing prior graphic design skills. Groups, acting as a Graphic Design Firm, would create a logo that represented the themes of their mission statement. Students were encouraged to constantly seek out feedback to strengthen their concepts. In addition, the rough drafts of the logos were presented to the class to promote constructive criticism. The groups then selected the most effective logo to create company letterheads, business cards, and envelopes.

Prior graphic design works were often cluttered, but a simple mission statement helped make my designs more impactful. I learned that carefully selecting the graphic elements creates a much stronger design. Despite my logo not being chosen, I was able to develop a previously unused graphic design skill. Overall, this unique project offered an engaging way to practice my ability to create a relevant logo that maintains the theme of a company.</p>

                <p class='projectDescription'>This assignment required students to create an effective colony layout. The layout needed to provide the colony with adequate defenses against potentially hostile natives. In addition, the layout needed to clearly identify the methods of agricultural growth relevant to the region. The map created must show the various economic opportunities present in the colony. Overall, all layout choices should consist with the climate and social conditions of the chosen region.

                <p class='projectDescription'>This assignment gave me the opportunity to create a map utilizing a Pokémon romhacking tool. This program gave me direct access to the sprites utilized in the game, so I was able to create a unique pixel art map. The program allows users to “draw” map tiles on top of previous textures which gave me plenty of freedom for designing a diverse landscape. In addition, the map created is fully compatible with a Gameboy Advance, so my peers were able to freely look around the created colony.
