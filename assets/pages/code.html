            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project featured the first major WordPress implementation in Web Design. We were tasked with making a study guide for students taking the End of Course exams. The pages of the website needed to feature interactive elements, so I needed to effectively implement plugins to improve the responsiveness of the site. In addition, the final product needed to be easily accessible to students, so maintaining a mobile version of the site was necessary.</p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>As the primary WordPress developer for this project, I was in charge of researching the most effective way to use the WordPress platform. WordPress handles visual elements differently from traditional HTML coding, so I improved my critical thinking skills through this project. In addition, this project strengthened my understanding of the importance of mockups and wireframes  Through the design choices made, we can implement new interactive features without breaking the normal flow of the site.</p>

            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project introduced me to developing for mobile users. Compared to a desktop site, the mobile version must be a much more minimalistic user interface. The project required my group to create an app that would solve a problem faced by my peers. We choose to focus on streamlining the college selection process as it was widely recognized as an overwhelming process. This android based app would help students sort through the large list of potential colleges for them. We included several filters (GPA, location, degree) to assist students in finding the best college for their needs. This project focused on letting students explore an open ended topic.</p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>I learned more about how useful usability testing is to create an effective app. I worked closely with the lead designers and coders to create a friendly user experience. The core focus of the assignment was to make the app relevant to teenagers, so I frequently utilized usability testing to identify severe issues with the functionality of the app. User interface design is my favorite aspect of graphic design, so I enjoyed developing this skill. Overall, I was able to contribute to the effectiveness of the app by implementing user feedback.</p>

            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project featured the first major PHP implementation in Web Design. We were tasked with making an interactive shopping site with that could pull information from a database. The items in the shop were not allowed to be coded in HTML, so I needed to effectively implement PHP to reduce a dependency on HTML. In addition, my designer created a complex mockup that further developed my HTML and CSS skills.</p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>As the PHP developer for this project, I was in charge of figuring out simple methods of pulling information from the database. PHP lacks a consistent way to verify why a certain block of code is not working, so I improved my debugging skills through this project. In addition, this project gave me the opportunity to optimize my existing code to improve the reliability of the database. Through the optimizations made, expanding the site to convert new genres is a simple process. </p>

            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project introduced me to adding more functionality to a site. Initially, the basic websites we created lacked the interactivity crucial for a successful site. However, this Ecuador themed travel site required us to meet the demands of a hypothetical client. One of the requirements of the project was to offer an English to Spanish translation. In addition, we needed to research accurate information that could easily be found. Usability testing was a core focus of the project as developers should consistently identify potential flaws in their current design. Overall, this large scale assignment required students to implement their current skills into a real world project.

                <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project helped clarify the necessity of usability testing to deliver an effective product. Maintaining an accessible site ensures that the client will be able to bring their website to a larger audience. I learned some interesting methods web developers use to offer accessibility to those who need it. The two major accessibility tools implemented were alternate text for those who are unable to see images and screen reader support. In addition, the translation function was fairly difficult as we were not given the “correct” method of implementation. Overall, this project contributed to my ability to quickly problem solve while taking feedback from clients and users.</p>
