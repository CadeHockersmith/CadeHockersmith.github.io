        <div id='productList'>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This volunteer tutorial required me to show my peers the steps necessary to set up a Github pages site connected to a repository. The audience of the presentation requested that every potential mishap was covered in the video. As many students have not interacted with Github prior to the tutorial, I attempted to make each step as easy to follow as possible.</p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>I learned more about the steps necessary to create an effective tutorial. I assumed that certain skills would have already been obtained which results in a difficult to follow tutorial. Writing the script for the tutorial helped me identify potential elements of confusion that I worked to clarify. This was the first code based tutorial that I have created, so I took user feedback to identify potential flaws. The steps required to create a Github pages site become increasingly difficult, so I worked towards slowing down the workflow to create an easy to follow video. </p>

            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>I was able to develop both my visual and auditory editing skills through this project.

Overall, this project helped me improve my understanding of history in an engaging way, while challenging my media creation skills. </p>

    <div class='marginFixer'>
        <div id='productList'>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>This project required students to create an advertisement through satirizing common persuasive methods. Students were able to show their understanding of these concepts, by creating a clearly biased advertisement. Celebrity endorsement was one of the many advertising methods offered, but my group believed that it would be the most effective to convey the general purpose of the commercial.</p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>As the writer for this project, I was able to develop my comical writing skills. We decided early on to create an entertaining commercial to interest our peers. A serious advertisement would be ineffective to students looking for an engaging product. In addition, my persuasive writing skills were improved due to this assignment. I closely worked with the editors of the video to create an effective communication. The script written outlined the most successful graphics we could use to motivate the audience to purchase the product. Overall, I was able to practice written skills by implementing them into a video assignment.</p>

            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Explanation:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>The purpose of this project was to identify a knowledgeable branding expert and recreate their steps towards an effective brand. I needed to convert the large amount of researched information into an easily understandable presentation. Students following along with the presentation were required to take notes, so the information needed to be concise. </p>
            <h3 class='productInfo'>Project Reflection:</h3>
            <p class='projectDescription'>I learned how important constant interaction with a client is for branding. I now know that client feedback is crucial for understanding the target audience of a specific product. Your client describes the general themes and goals of the media to be created, so these guidelines help the designer make the best possible design for the client. Overall, I learned how to easily create a branding package for a client through the research done.</p>
