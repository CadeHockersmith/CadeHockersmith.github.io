    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This Business Software Application project required me to learn the basics of marketing and advertisement creation. We were taught to identify the target audience of a product while maintaining relevant information for that group. In addition, a variety of custom assets had to be created to effectively communicate the purpose. The project required me to create a reasonable budget for the assets. I learned to research the most cost effective methods that deliver reasonable quality for the price. The project focused on implementing effective work habits that would encourage me to maintain an efficient work schedule.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed this project as it gave me the opportunity to learn valuable skills. I learned more about creating an effective script which directly resulted in improving my writing abilities. In addition, I was able to practice the layout and design skills I received from graphic design. Overall, this project introduced me to marketing skills while improving my ability as a graphic designer.</p>

        <iframe width="900" height="600"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_H4yp_LQTM"  frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this project was to identify a knowledgeable branding expert and recreate their steps towards an effective brand. I needed to convert the large amount of researched information into an easily understandable presentation.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p> learned how important constant interaction with a client is for branding. I now know that client feedback is crucial for understanding the target audience of a specific product. Your client describes the general themes and goals of the media to be created, so these guidelines help the designer make the best possible design for the client.</p>

        <iframe width="900" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQ5D3HP0pdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p> This volunteer tutorial required me to show my peers the steps necessary to set up a Github pages site connected to a repository. As many students have not interacted with Github prior to the tutorial, I attempted to make each step as easy to follow as possible.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned more about the steps necessary to create an effective tutorial. I assumed that certain skills would have already been obtained which results in a difficult to follow tutorial. Writing the script for the tutorial helped me identify potential elements of confusion that I worked to clarify.

    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project required students to recreate a significant event through the use of ASCII and binary code. The event was broken down to its simplest elements to easily transmit the information to another student. I was expected to justify the enMedia systems used to  further my understanding of this code.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned more about the specific uses of Binary and ASCII code to transmit information. Consistently minimizing the amount of data sent to just the bare essentials resulted in a challenging final product. I wanted to ensure that every single step accurately represented an efficient compression system.</p>
