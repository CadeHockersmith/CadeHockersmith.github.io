    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project required me to identify a severe issue in modern day society while offering a solution that would be accepted by both sides of the issue. The topic was open ended to encourage students to choose an issue that they could passionately identify with. The points made must be supported with strong evidence that accurately identifies the problem. This was a useful way to revisit MLA citations in a relevant project. Students with opposing beliefs were encouraged to participate, so the end solution would represent both sides equally.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>My topic, Internet Censorship, motivated me to research more about its implementation nationwide. Prior to my research, I completely refused to accept the Internet Censorship should be utilized in the modern age. However, evidence referenced by those with opposing viewpoints offered defendable evidence that resulted in me understanding their beliefs. This project taught me how to accept audience feedback when arguing a solution. Persuasive writing skills are an incredibly valuable asset for communicative works. Overall, this project contributed to my ability to successfully present information in future assignments.

    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This assignment introduced the basic concepts of writing an effective narrative. Creating a character, setting, and plot that the reader would be able to easily identify with was a vital aspect of the essay. An engaging story with significant plot events would draw the reader into the world created. The project stressed the importance of utilizing dialogue to bring the story forward. Readers want to interact with a varied narrative, so choosing to narrate the entire events of the plot will disinterest the reader. </p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned more about how to effectively implement details throughout the narrative. The rough draft of my narrative skipped over vital details like character and setting descriptions. Through peer response, I recognized that adding these details would help the reader care more about the narrativeâ€™s progression. In addition, the low amount of dialogue present prevented the reader from identifying with the characters. Narrator details are unable to create a colorful character that shows a wide variety of personality traits. Overall, this narrative taught me how to create an enjoyable experience for the reader through the use of relevant details.

    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project required students to identify a topic related to the Internet and its impact on people and society. The purpose of this flash talk was to demonstrate my knowledge of the Internet and how it works by connecting the information to a relevant topic. The previous lessons covered the technology behind digital security, so the potential topics referenced this concept. The end goal of the assignment was to summarize a complicated issue into an easily understandable presentation.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I chose to research the topic of Internet Censorship as it continued to be relevant within the news. Protecting digital freedom is a vital aspect of ensuring the growth of the United States. I believe that myself and my peers should be educated in understanding the potential flaws of the Internet. By identifying common misconceptions about Internet Censorship, my peers were able to better understand this topic. Overall, I was able to improve my presentation skills by summarizing the information researched within a small speech.</p>
