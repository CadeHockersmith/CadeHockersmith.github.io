    <h2>CollegeKnowledge</h2>
    <iframe width="900" height="600" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQ5D3HP0pdQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project introduced me to developing for mobile users. Compared to a desktop site, the mobile version must be a much more minimalistic user interface. The project required my group to create an app that would solve a problem faced by my peers. We choose to focus on streamlining the college selection process as it was widely recognized as an overwhelming process. This android based app would help students sort through the large list of potential colleges for them. We included several filters (GPA, location, degree) to assist students in finding the best college for their needs. This project focused on letting students explore an open ended topic.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned more about how useful usability testing is to create an effective app. I worked closely with the lead designers and coders to create a friendly user experience. The core focus of the assignment was to make the app relevant to teenagers, so I frequently utilized usability testing to identify severe issues with the functionality of the app. User interface design is my favorite aspect of graphic design, so I enjoyed developing this skill. Overall, I was able to contribute to the effectiveness of the app by implementing user feedback.</p>

    <h2>Ecuador Site</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="/assets/projects/c_ecuador/index.html"><img src="assets/img/ecuadorImg.png" height="600px" width="900px"> </a>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project introduced me to adding more functionality to a site. Initially, the basic websites we created lacked the interactivity crucial for a successful site. However, this Ecuador themed travel site required us to meet the demands of a hypothetical client. One of the requirements of the project was to offer an English to Spanish translation. In addition, we needed to research accurate information that could easily be found. Usability testing was a core focus of the project as developers should consistently identify potential flaws in their current design. Overall, this large scale assignment required students to implement their current skills into a real world project.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>This project helped clarify the necessity of usability testing to deliver an effective product. Maintaining an accessible site ensures that the client will be able to bring their website to a larger audience. I learned some interesting methods web developers use to offer accessibility to those who need it. The two major accessibility tools implemented were alternate text for those who are unable to see images and screen reader support. In addition, the translation function was fairly difficult as we were not given the “correct” method of implementation. This encouraged me to research a wide variety of techniques that could have been used. Overall, this project contributed to my ability to quickly problem solve while taking feedback from clients and users.</p>

    <h2>Javascript Quizmaker</h2>
        <a target="_blank" href="/assets/projects/c_quizmaker/index.html"><img src="assets/img/quizmakerImg.png" height="600px" width="900px"> </a>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project featured the first major javascript implementation of Web Design. We were tasked with making a fully functional quiz with randomized questions and verified responses. The questions and answers were not allowed to be coded into HTML, so I needed to rapidly learn Javascript to meet the expectations of the project. In addition, a fully functioning site was required, so HTML and CSS skills were developed with the project.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>As the Javascript developer for this project, I was in charge of figuring out the most effective methods creating an interactive quiz. I learned how to efficiently debug Javascript code to identify a potential solution for the error. In addition, this project gave me the opportunity to try out Github’s pages site. I have continued to utilize Github in later projects, so I am incredibly thankful that the Quizmaker project motivated me to try it out.</p>

    <h2>Greek Legend Interactive</h2>
        <iframe src="assets/projects/c_perseus/Perseus.html" height="600px" width="900px"> </iframe>
    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>Students were tasked with creating an easily understandable recreation of the journey of Greek hero Perseus. The deliverable was completely open to student interpretation which resulted in the experimental Twine interactive game. We chose this implementation as the class would be able to control the overall progression of the game. We wanted to ensure that our peers would continue to be interested throughout the duration of our project. Overall, this unique project encouraged students to experiment with an innovative deliverable to communicate the journey of a Greek hero.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned the core concepts of HTML and CSS with the interactive Twine medium. This program can be easily changed with CSS code, so I was able to program layouts for the first time. I learned the basics of the CSS syntax which better prepared me for more complex assignments. This project was my first interaction with creating an effective User Interface which is my favorite part of designing for the web. Overall, I enjoyed that the Twine program supports major design changes without the complexity of raw CSS code.</p>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">4000 bits(0 - 500 chars)</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Describing the overall structure of the venue is an important part of recreating the experience. Since one ascii character takes up 8 bits (or 1 byte), 4,000 bits allows us to send a complete paragraph about the visual aspect of the experience. It is unreasonable to receive a complete essay describing the appearance of the venue, so I do not need to offer more than 500 characters.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">ASCII</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">5 bits( 32 values)</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Number is the total amount of people within the venue. 5 bits offers 32 total values of people participating inside the tournament. The venue I go to typically reachers 16 people, but the extra space ensures that the experience can be recreated without the risk of an overflow.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">Number</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">2 separate 6 bits (128 values but only 92 are needed for each state.)</td>
    <td class="tg-yw4l">Longitude and latitude both reach a cap of 90. However, that value can either be negative or positive, so it is important to have two extra values that describe the sign of the coordinates. These specific values take up much less space than the name of the street that the venue is on.</td>

    <td class="tg-yw4l">First value is the time the venue opens while the second value is the time the venue closes. These values are both in military time to save space while encoding the data. In addition, this format assumes that the tournament opens at a whole number which is a safe assumption to make. Typically, the first hour of a tournament is dedicated to friendly matches, so anyone receiving this message will not miss out on the actual event.</td>

    <h3>Project Explanation</h3>
    <p>This project required students to recreate a significant event through the use of ASCII and binary code. The event was broken down to its simplest elements to easily transmit the information to another student. I was expected to justify the encoding systems used to  further my understanding of this code.</p>
    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
    <p>I learned more about the specific uses of Binary and ASCII code to transmit information. Consistently minimizing the amount of data sent to just the bare essentials resulted in a challenging final product. I wanted to ensure that every single step accurately represented an efficient compression system.</p>
